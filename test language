I have added Spanish (es) and German (de) localization to the website.

How to test:

Spanish: index.html?lang=es
German: index.html?lang=de
French: index.html?lang=fr
English: index.html?lang=en
As before, "Sanitized Ai" remains untranslated in all versions. The correct language will also be automatically detected based on the user's browser settings if no URL parameter is provided.
